# Node.js Calculator

The purpose of this program was to learn more about unit testing using the [mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/) framework and the [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/) task runner.

Originally I followed [this](https://www.taniarascia.com/unit-testing-in-javascript/) tutorial, but after I grasped the concepts I refactored the code, added a couple more tests, implemented a retry feature, and added gulp functionality.
